# Documentation index

This repository keeps authoritative design and operational documents under DOCS/. High-value files are kept in the root of DOCS for visibility, with topic-specific subfolders for automation, AI and DB/migrations.

Key canonical files (single-source-of-truth):

- `DOCS/blueprint_ssot_v1.1.md` — product blueprint, taxonomies, and geography SSOT (Immutable unless via RFC).
- `DOCS/FILE_MANIFEST.md` — catalogue of key docs and their purpose.

Subfolders (high-level):

- `DOCS/automation/` — automation runbooks, cron/runbook secrets, ABN/Stripe rollouts, and operational checklists.
- `DOCS/ai/` — AI agent playbooks and AI execution guides (phase prompts and agent checklists).
- `DOCS/db/` — database-related guides and a migrations index (see `DOCS/db/MIGRATIONS_INDEX.md`).
- `DOCS/_legacy/` — archived or superseded documentation kept for traceability. Files here should include a short note when moved.
