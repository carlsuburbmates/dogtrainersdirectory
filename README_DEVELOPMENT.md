# Development (Pointer Only)

This file is intentionally short. Canonical setup, ops workflows, and contracts live in `DOCS/SSOT/`.

## Quick Start
1. `npm install`
2. `cp .env.example .env.local` (see `DOCS/SSOT/09_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
3. `npm run dev`

## Where to look
- Environment + deploy: `DOCS/SSOT/09_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Ops workflows + scripts: `DOCS/SSOT/08_OPS_RUNBOOK.md`
- Data + API contracts: `DOCS/SSOT/03_DATA_CONTRACTS.md`, `DOCS/SSOT/04_API_CONTRACTS.md`
